# Hospital-Database #Coursework
Synopsis:
- A project where I created a hospital database based on instructions and parameters set by teacher.

Description:
- I constructed a Hospital Database based on a "customer's" verbal description
- I built the database in "Phases" as instructed by the professor.
- I did the following in order to build the database: created the E-R Model, wrote Java code to help with automation, constructed the schema, built the tables, filling the tables with data, and working with SQL queries to get the desired data
- This project was done in SQLDeveloper and "my" database was hosted using Oracle through the University of New Orleans.
- I completed 6 Phases of the project.

Feel free to check out the ER Diagram, my Java code, or any of the SQL code.

**Disclaimer: The database server is not open to the public (and my specific database may be deleted at this point), but I believe the diagram, SQL code, and Java code shows my understanding of Relational Databases**
